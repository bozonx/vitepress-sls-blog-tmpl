# Advanced JSON-LD Test

This page demonstrates advanced JSON-LD features including array support for `isPartOf`.

## Array Support

The `isPartOf` field can be an array of objects, which is useful when content belongs to multiple parent entities.

## Generated JSON-LD

The transformer will generate structured data like this:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "name": "Advanced JSON-LD Test Article",
  "url": "https://example.com/advanced-json-ld",
  "description": "This article tests advanced JSON-LD features including arrays",
  "isPartOf": [
    {
      "@type": "WebSite",
      "name": "Main Website",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    },
    { "@type": "Blog", "name": "My Blog", "url": "https://example.com/blog" }
  ]
}
```

## Use Cases

- Content that belongs to multiple sections
- Articles published in multiple blogs
- Pages that are part of different site sections

## YAML Syntax Note

Remember to use quotes for fields starting with `@`:

```yaml
"@type": Article  # Correct
@type: Article    # Incorrect
```

## Actual Generated JSON-LD Data

Below you can see the actual JSON-LD data that was generated from the YAML in the frontmatter:
